"""Integration guidance delivered with an integration's action schemas.

When an integration's actions are loaded into a session (add_action_sets, a
skill's recommended sets, or a run's declared sets), the schemas arrive in the
event stream together with that integration's workflow guidance, so the model
has the rules in context before its first call. Which provider a set belongs
to is read from where its actions come from (integration_ids_for_action_sets).

Guidance sources, in order:
  1. ``craftos_integrations/providers/<id>/GUIDANCE.md`` — multi-account
     providers (the file is already essentials-sized and includes the
     multi-account rules: extract account qualifiers like "my school
     calendar" into the ``account`` param).
  2. ``craftos_integrations/providers/<id>/INTEGRATION.md`` ``##
     Essentials`` block.
